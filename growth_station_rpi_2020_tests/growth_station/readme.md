# Growth Station

This file contains basic information about each growth station.

## Installation

Currently we do not have an automated system to deploy the software on a Growth Station. Please follow the steps below instead.

### Part 1 - Directories and Files

The first step to get the Growth Station up and running involves managing directories and files. Here are the steps:

1. Copy the contents of the directory `growth_station` to a location of your choice on the Raspberry Pi.

2. Create a `logs` directory in a location of your choice on the Raspberry Pi.

3. Edit the `logs_dir` variable in your `gs_controller.py` file to match the location of your logs directory.

### Part 2 - System Settings

Next, we need to make sure that the OS of the Raspberry Pi knows how to manage the script. [Add more here later]
